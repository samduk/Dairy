Today we are going to learn about codeigniter and I am very excited about it. Though I don't consider myself as a professional hard core PHP developer but I would definitely consider myself as a PHP enthusiast! 

I was so happy to see the face of codeigniter despite I never had the time to get to know about it, because we are now shift to cakephp - a framework which I have some preconcieved notion (ahem bad ahem )

Anyway, I am installing the cake now.. catch you in awhile. I have installed cakephp successfully. It took couple of hours. Now I need to go through documentation parts and other resources to get myself comfortable playing in the environment.
